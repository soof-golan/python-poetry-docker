# python-poetry-docker

This is an example repository that demonstrates how to use `poetry` as your package manager withing a Docker image.

# 🤔 Why does this exist?

This began when I was tinkering with trying to dockerize a small project that I managed with `poetry`. All the guides I found we're not good enough, so I created my own, so you don't have to suffer 😅.
